                            about exponential objects in category theory and cartesian closed categories, which give us an interesting connection
                            to logic and formal deductive systems. Everyone is welcome!

                                            Monday: Duality in category theory. We defined products and coproducts.

                                            We defined the category of arrows, slice category and coslice category. 
                                            We ended the lecture with natural transformation between functors.

                <h2>
                        Description of the course
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Approximately one year ago a group of enthusiastic mathematicians started the Category Theory
                        Reading Group which has been active since then.
                        Because reading category theory independently is a challenging task and there is a growing interest
                        in the topic,
                        this year there will be a lectured course about category theory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Category theory is a field of mathematics in which a language is created to look for very general
                        patterns that permeate through all of mathematics.
                        Category theory gives a new, very algebraic lense to view mathematics.
                        Itâ€™s a lot of fun but it requires that one has studied the object which we put into the categories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The topics are the same as in <a
                            href="https://courses.helsinki.fi/fi/mast31031/124853389">Introduction to Category Theory I</a>,
                        but made a bit easier.
                        The outline of the course is roughly following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Definition of category
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Category theoretical constructions
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Functors and natural transformations
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If there is time, either limits in category theory or Yoneda's lemma
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Prerequisites
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        It would be necessary to know basic set theory and especially intersections
                        and unions over different (possibly uncountable infinite) indexing sets.
                        The ideas from abstract algebra, such as groups, subgroups, quotient groups, homomorphisms and
                        equivalence relations will come up.
                        It would be nice if people know that a continuous function can be defined as a function such that
                        the inverse image of any open set is an open set.
                    </p>
